                <p>My name is Rena Hashimi, a 34-year-old living in Oslo. I’m married, a mother to two wonderful children, and work full-time in the field of optics. Alongside these responsibilities, I am also pursuing my passion for technology by studying to become a Frontend Developer at the Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, having just completed my first year.</p>
                <p>Technology, coding, web development, and design have always been my passions. After spending nearly 16 years in customer service, I decided it was time for a career shift and took the leap to follow my dream of becoming a developer.</p>
                <p>My first year at Noroff was incredibly rewarding, and now in my fourth semester, I’m even more excited for the opportunity to continue deepening my knowledge and growing as a developer.</p>
