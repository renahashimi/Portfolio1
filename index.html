                <p>My name is Rena Hashimi, I am 34 years old and live in Oslo. I am married, mother of two beautiful children and work full-time in optics. With all this on the plate, I am also studying Frontend developer at the Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media and have now completed my first year.</p>
                <p>Since I can remember, I have always had a great passion for IT, coding, web development and design. After working in customer service for almost 16 years, it was time for a career change and I decided to fulfill my dream of becoming a developer.</p>
                <p>The first year in Noroff has been very educational and I look forward to next year for the opportunity to gain more knowledge and further develop myself as a developer.</p>
